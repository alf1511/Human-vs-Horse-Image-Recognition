# Human-vs-Horse-Image-Recognition
This project's primary objective revolves around the development of a sophisticated model capable of accurately classifying images of humans and horses. TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning framework, is utilized as the primary tool for constructing this model. The structural design employed in this project centers around the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a widely recognized and effective approach for image classification tasks. Additionally, particular emphasis is placed on two critical processes: data augmentation and transfer learning. These techniques are incorporated to enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities by augmenting the training data and leveraging pre-trained models' knowledge for improved classification accuracy.
